# Bus Station (ProgrammingII Course Project)
 
## Objective

● Design a complete object-oriented system.

● Draw a UML Class Diagram.

● Practice on the concept of inheritance and polymorphism.

● Get to know files and exceptions.

● More practice on GUI.


## Description
This project is almost a complete simulation for a real-life bus station. First, we have the bus
station itself with a complete set of vehicles like a bus, minibus, limousine, ...etc. Second, there are the employees who are divided into drivers and managers. Third, the passengers (customers) who are trying to buy a ticket for a specific trip.A customer can reserve one-way trip or round trip. Fourth, we have two main types of trips; internal (between cities) and
external (between countries), they differ in price, distance, ...etc. Also, a trip can be nonstop, one-stop or many stops. Develop a simulator for such a system in Java using the OO concepts you have covered in the course till now. Develop a GUI that should support two modes of operations for two main actors: passengers and employees.You should work with files too to store the trips information, passengers’ list for each bus, ...etc.
